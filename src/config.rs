//! Pluggable configuration trait surface for quote verification.
//!
//! Quote verification depends on a small set of operations on certificates,
//! signatures, and crypto primitives. Each is captured by a small trait so a
//! downstream consumer (e.g. a smart contract building for WASM) can supply a
//! smaller-footprint implementation without forking this crate. The audited
//! in-tree implementations live in [`crate::x509`], [`crate::signature`], and
//! [`crate::crypto`]; the bundles in [`crate::configs`] (incl.
//! [`DefaultConfig`](crate::configs::DefaultConfig)) pair them into ready-to-use
//! [`Config`]s.
//!
//! ## Config trait
//!
//! [`Config`] bundles the pluggable components as associated types so they can
//! be swapped independently — e.g. keep the audited cert parser but bring your
//! own micro-encoder. A custom config is just a marker type implementing
//! [`Config`]:
//!
//! ```ignore
//! struct MyConfig;
//! impl dcap_qvl::config::Config for MyConfig {
//!     type X509       = dcap_qvl::x509::X509CertBackend; // keep audited
//!     type SigEncoder = MyMicroEncoder;                  // custom
//!     type Crypto     = dcap_qvl::crypto::RingCrypto;
//! }
//!
//! dcap_qvl::verify::verify_with::<MyConfig>(quote, &collateral, now)?;
//! ```
//!
//! ## Auditing
//!
//! Only the in-tree backends ([`crate::x509::X509CertBackend`],
//! [`crate::signature::DerSigEncoder`], [`crate::crypto::RingCrypto`] /
//! [`crate::crypto::RustCryptoCrypto`]) and the bundles in [`crate::configs`]
//! are audited as part of `dcap-qvl`. Custom implementations of [`X509Codec`]
//! / [`ParsedCert`] / [`EcdsaSigEncoder`] / [`CryptoProvider`] are the
//! implementer's responsibility; they SHOULD be checked for byte-for-byte
//! equivalence against [`DefaultConfig`](crate::configs::DefaultConfig) on a
//! representative corpus (see `tests/config_conformance.rs`).
//!
//! ## Trait shape
//!
//! Sub-trait methods (other than [`X509Codec::from_der`]) are associated
//! functions, not `&self` methods, so backends are expected to be zero-sized
//! marker types. [`X509Codec`] is the exception: it produces a [`ParsedCert`]
//! that owns or borrows the parsed data, so multiple field accesses share a
//! single parse.
